# Breaking changes

Since there is no stable release yet, there is also no proper changelog yet. But
since not everyone might want to dive through commit messages to find out what's
new and what's changed, this document lists all breaking changes in reverse
chronological order. If a new feature did not require any changes to existing
code then it will not be listed here.

## [2022-05-22]

- Previously calling `param.non_automatable()` when constructing a parameter
  also made the parameter hidden. Hiding a parameter is now done through
  `param.hide()`, while `param.non_automatable()` simply makes it so that the
  parameter can only be changed manually and not through automation or
  modulation.
